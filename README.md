# CS4775 Readme

Attached is the compiled program 'sparse' which contains our work for LD score.

You can run the LD calculator by runing

> ./sparse -ld -g <location of plink file> -w <window size> -o <output file>

An example of using it is as follows:

> ./sparse -ld -g data/data -w 10000 -o out/test

## Simulated data

We could not attach all the data we simulated for the files, but the generation files are attached inside the tests folder.

There is an ipynb file which was used for creating and filtering the data, after installing the correct packages, it should be usable.
